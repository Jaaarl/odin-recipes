    <p>Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico. In Spanish, coquito means "little
        coconut." The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum. Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened
        with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog. In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."</p>
