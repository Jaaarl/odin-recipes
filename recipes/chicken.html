        This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to
        ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.

    <h2>What Makes This Fried Chicken So Crispy?</h2>
    <p>
        There are a few reasons this crispy fried chicken works so well:

        · Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like consistency is key to a crispiness on the
        outside and juiciness on the inside.
        · Most fried chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying process. This one, however, only
        starts at a very high heat — after browning, the heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up the
        temperature again at the end, locking in that crispy texture.
        · Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with browning the chicken.
